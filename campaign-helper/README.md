This is a simple helper script to add tracking links like `?mtm_campaign=foo` to
links in a bunch of rich text. They'll only be added to links in an allow-list
of domain names.

The purpose is to quickly instrument links included in, e.g., newsletters with
Matomo-compatible campaign tracking.

To run it, just open index.html in a browser.
